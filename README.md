# Apollo16
Vibrate like you travel to the stars!

Apollo16 is a security project where we had to build a vibrator for the Internet of Things. The biggest challenge we had was that we had to accept certain conditions.

1 The vibrator had to be Gender Neutral
2 An other condition was that we had to use a ESP8266 Module for WiFi
3 We only had several weeks to create a LoFi prototype, HiFi prototype and the Product itself

Besides these conditions we had to learn how to program in C/C++ and had to implement Encryption, Hashing and other security meassures.
